# My Story

I grew up mostly in Tunisia, but due to my father's work, we often had to move from country to country. You could say I was like an "oiseau migrateur" a migratory bird constantly discovering new cultures and meeting new people, only to say goodbye a year later. These experiences made me adaptable, resilient, and comfortable in any environment. I learned how to make friends quickly, even when we didn‚Äôt speak the same language. üòä

From a young age, I‚Äôve also been a competitor at heart. I love sports and thrive in competition, whether it‚Äôs on the soccer field, volleyball court, or playing padel. I also enjoy competitive video games. I‚Äôm drawn to the challenge of improving every day, learning from each match, and performing under pressure.

My passion for technology started early too. After high school, I chose to study Computer Science because I wanted to create video games. In 2022, I moved to San Francisco and began studying Computer Science before transferring to San Jos√© State University to pursue a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Data Science.

Why Data Science? To be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt say I ‚Äúlove‚Äù it the way I love soccer, the gym, or traveling with friends. But I‚Äôm deeply interested and curious about it. I want to understand how data can solve real-world problems, and I enjoy learning and growing in this field.

I‚Äôm currently a junior, expecting to graduate in May 2026, and I‚Äôm actively seeking an internship in Data Analysis, Data Engineering, or Machine Learning. What I‚Äôm looking for is hands-on experience, an opportunity to learn, contribute, and grow as a future data scientist.

# Volunteer Activities
As a member of the UNESCO Club at Lyc√©e Gustave Flaubert (LGF) in La Marsa, I actively participated in impactful community service and environmental initiatives. One memorable experience was organizing a beach clean-up at Gammarth Beach. Equipped with gloves and bags, our team of volunteers worked diligently under the morning sun, collecting litter and raising awareness among local beachgoers about the importance of preserving our coastline.

In collaboration with Tunisian organizations, we also coordinated fundraisers to collect school supplies for underprivileged schools in regions like A√Øn Draham. Visiting these schools to personally deliver notebooks, pens, and other essentials allowed me to witness firsthand the students' enthusiasm and gratitude. Additionally, we organized drives to gather winter clothing and food items, ensuring that vulnerable communities had the necessary resources during the colder months.

# LeaderShip Activities 

**Student President** 
 
Upon my arrival at City College of San Francisco (CCSF), I became an active member of the Associated Students Council of Ocean Campus (ASCO), the elected body representing student interests. Initially serving as a senator, I collaborated with fellow council members to support various student-led initiatives and participated in decision-making processes through recommendations, allocations, and resolutions. This role provided me with valuable insights into the educational and student governance systems within community colleges.

Attending a statewide leadership conference further expanded my perspective, allowing me to network with student leaders from campuses across California. Inspired by this experience, I pursued and was elected to the position of ASCO president. In this capacity, I lead a team of eighteen student leaders, including six vice presidents and twelve senators. My responsibilities encompass overseeing the orientation and training of vice presidents, ensuring all council members fulfill ASCO requirements, and collaborating with the Vice President of Finance to establish and submit the council's academic budget. Additionally, chairing weekly meetings with over twenty participants has enhanced my presentation and public speaking abilities.

This leadership journey has significantly developed my skills in building trust within a team, mentoring peers, and effectively managing multiple responsibilities. It has also instilled a strong sense of accountability, as I work to represent and advocate for the diverse student body at CCSF.
