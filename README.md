### ðŸš¢ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
[Publication](https://github.com/JaafarBK02/titanic-machine-learning-project)

The Titanic Machine Learning project involves predicting the survival of passengers aboard the ill-fated Titanic voyage using machine learning techniques. By applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and categorical encoding, I built a logistic regression model to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors. The project demonstrates key machine learning skills, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. I visualized important features like age, gender, and class to uncover patterns in survival rates.




### ðŸ’£ Minesweeper Game (Class-Project) 

Developed a fully functional Minesweeper game with a GUI using **Python** and **Tkinter**, featuring a dynamic 9x9 grid with randomized mine placement. The game utilizes a 2D array for efficient grid management and state tracking, ensuring real-time user interaction through the Tkinter graphical interface. To handle cell revealing, I implemented a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm, allowing adjacent non-mine cells to be uncovered smoothly. The game loop integrates live input handling, mine detection, and win/loss condition checks to maintain seamless gameplay. Additionally, I optimized grid traversal and cell reveal algorithms to enhance efficiency, resulting in a responsive and engaging user experience.
